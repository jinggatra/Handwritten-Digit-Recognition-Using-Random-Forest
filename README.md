# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-Random-Forest
Trained a Random Forest classifier on the MNIST dataset to perform handwriting recognition of
digits on images of 28x28 resolution. The classifier predicts the handwritten digit in the image
and returns the result as a number from 0 to 9.

The validation accuracy achieved was: <b>94.2%</b>
